# Quickstart Node + Babel + Flow

This skeleton project will give you everything you need
to get a node project started that transpiles with
babel, uses Flow for static typing, and has sane and
strict defaults for eslint and flow.

As-is, this should just work pretty much out of the box
in Nuclide, if that's what you use.
